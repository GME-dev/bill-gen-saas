# TMR Motorcycle Bill Generator

This is a SaaS application for generating motorcycle service bills for TMR Motorcycle Services.

## Features

- Generate and manage motorcycle service bills
- Track customer information
- Maintain a database of bike models
- Generate PDF invoices
- Track payment status

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts:

- **Frontend**: React application (NextJS)
- **Backend**: NodeJS API (Express + MongoDB)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB (local or via Docker)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bill-gen-saas.git
   cd bill-gen-saas
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on `.env.example`
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory based on `.env.example`

4. Start the development servers:

   For the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   docker-compose up -d  # Starts MongoDB
   npm run dev
   ```

   For the frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080

## Docker Setup

To run the entire application using Docker:

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running
2. Run:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. The application will be available at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using Docker and the provided GitHub Actions workflows.

### Prerequisites for deployment:

1. Set up the following GitHub secrets:
   - `DOCKER_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for SSH deployment

2. Set up the following GitHub variables:
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DEPLOY_HOST`: The deployment server hostname
   - `DEPLOY_USER`: The deployment server username

The application will be automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## GitHub Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow includes:

1. **Testing**: Runs tests and linting for both frontend and backend
2. **Building**: Builds Docker images for both frontend and backend
3. **Deployment**: Deploys the application to the production server

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.

### Setting up GitHub Actions

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
3. Add the required secrets and variables as listed in the Deployment prerequisites

### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

1. Build the Docker images:
   ```
   cd backend
   docker build -t yourusername/bill-gen-saas-backend:latest .
   
   cd ../frontend
   docker build -t yourusername/bill-gen-saas-frontend:latest .
   ```

2. Push the images to Docker Hub:
   ```
   docker push yourusername/bill-gen-saas-backend:latest
   docker push yourusername/bill-gen-saas-frontend:latest
   ```

3. SSH into your server and update the containers:
   ```
   cd /opt/bill-gen-saas
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```
